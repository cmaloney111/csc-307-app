Hi again professor or TA!

Assuming you don't already have one yourself, here is a shortcut to run both the 
frontend and backend in my repository with just "npm start":

To run from the repository's root folder, install concurrently with:
```
npm install concurrently
```
Then simply run with:
```
npm start
```

Of course if you would like to do it the long way, you can always go to packages/express-backend
and run npm start, and then go to packages/react-frontend and run npm start.
